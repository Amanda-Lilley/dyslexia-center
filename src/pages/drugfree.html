        One of the main goals of the Davis® Program is to enable a person to correct their perceptions and control their attention on their own without the use of medication. A person under the influence of certain medications is not able to experience the contrast and improvement that voluntary control of orientation has on their learning ability as well as their creativity.
      </p> 
      
      <p>
        Medicines such as antihistamines, codeine-based cough syrups, stimulants (Ritalin, Concerta, Strattera, etc.), and antidepressants (Prozac, Zoloft, etc.) should be avoided. These medications inhibit a person’s ability to use creative thought, or to visualize or picture things using imagination. This becomes significant when doing a Davis Program. During the Program, clients are asked to use multi-dimensional thought and perceptual abilities that are quite natural for them. Psychoactive drugs inhibit the individual’s ability to use these talents.

        In order to ensure that the client receives the full benefits of the Davis Program, full disclosure of current medications being taken (including nonprescription medications or natural, herbal remedies), is essential. Also, whenever possible, the client should refrain from certain medications for at least one week prior to starting a Program. <b>However, no prescribed medication should ever be discontinued without seeking the advice and permission of the physician who prescribed it.</b>  </p>

          This doesn’t mean that it is impossible for a medicated person to do the Davis procedures. Medications such as antibiotics and aspirin, when necessary to treat a temporary physical problem, are acceptable. Also acceptable are medications for chronic conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and asthma.

        <p>
          Medication for inattention is a very personal decision. However, many parents don't realize that medications for ADD and ADHD are strong stimulants that were not originally intended for use in children.

          If the subject of medicating your child for inattention has been brought up by his/her doctor or school system, but you are uncomfortable with giving your child stimulants, the Davis® methods can help!
          
          Davis clients are provided with techniques for self-focus, stress release, and self-control of internal energy-levels, making the use of stimulant medication unneccessary. Clients can use these techniques in all areas of their lives - not just in an academic setting.
