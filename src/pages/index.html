       Welcome to New England Dyslexia Center
     </h3>
     <p>
      New England Dyslexia center, located in Fairhaven, Massachusetts, proudly offers the Davis Dyslexia Correction ® Program to clients ages 8 and up. This one-week, intensive, goal-oriented program is designed for the visual-spatial learner! Facilitated one to-one in a fun and supportive setting, the clients leave with life-changing skills. Focusing techniques and understanding how to resolve confusions with letters, words, and other symbols using their creativity and imagination are key features of the
      program.  Reading exercises that eliminate guessing and promote
      comprehension and improved balance and coordination establish a firm
      foundation upon which clients can continue to achieve their learning
      goals.
