      <h3>
        The Program
      </h3>
      The Davis® program is a 30-hour one-week program which is facilitated one-on- one. Each program is customized to address the client's specific goals and areas for improvement. Because it is a creative program and is designed for the learning style of the visual-spatial person, clients work with their natural strengths and talents to overcome their learning obstacles. While many other programs address only the symptoms of the learning disability, the Davis methods get to the root cause of the learning difficulty. Clients will leave with the ability to implement the knowledge obtained during the program into daily life.

        <h3>
          Program Prerequisites
        </h3>
        <p>
          For the Davis Program to be effective, a person must be personally motivated and willing to improve some aspect of learning or school performance. The Davis Dyslexia Correction program is a DRUG FREE solution. Therefore, before a program can be scheduled, clients must disclose all medications. If you have any questions about these requirements, please call 508-994-4577 or email carolyntyler@launchlive.net.

      <h3>
        After the Program
      </h3>
      
      <p>
        The program provides the client with all of the tools, understanding, and materials necessary to implement the strategies into their every day lives and achieve positive results. Davis Symbol Mastery® trigger words (those words that do not have a visual image) is an essential part of the correction of Dyslexia. Support Training is provided on the last day for family members, tutor(s) and/or teacher(s) who will support the client in this follow-up.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h3>Drug Free Solution</h3>
      
      <p>
        One of the main goals of the Davis® Program is to enable a person to correct their perceptions and control their attention on their own without the use of medication. A person under the influence of certain medications is not able to experience the contrast and improvement that voluntary control of orientation has on their learning ability as well as their creativity.
        
      </p> 
      <p>
        Medicines such as antihistamines, codeine-based cough syrups, stimulants (Ritalin, Concerta, Strattera, etc.), and antidepressants (Prozac, Zoloft, etc.) should be avoided. These medications inhibit a person’s ability to use creative thought, or to visualize or picture things using imagination. This becomes significant when doing a Davis Program. During the Program, clients are asked to use multi-dimensional thought and perceptual abilities that are quite natural for them. Psychoactive drugs inhibit the individual’s ability to use these talents.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In order to ensure that the client receives the full benefits of the Davis Program, full disclosure of current medications being taken (including nonprescription medications or natural, herbal remedies), is essential. Also, whenever possible, the client should refrain from certain medications for at least one week prior to starting a Program. <b>However, no prescribed medication should ever be discontinued without seeking the advice and permission of the physician who prescribed it.</b>  </p>
        
        <p>
          This doesn’t mean that it is impossible for a medicated person to do the Davis procedures. Medications such as antibiotics and aspirin, when necessary to treat a temporary physical problem, are acceptable. Also acceptable are medications for chronic conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and asthma.
